     ```json
     {
       "document_type": "invoice",
       "invoice_number": "INV12345",
       "date": "2023-10-01",
       "total_amount": 500.00,
       "vendor_name": "ABC Corporation",
       "vendor_address": "123 Main St, City, State, ZIP",
       "billing_address": "456 Elm St, City, State, ZIP",
       "items": [
         {
           "item_name": "Product A",
           "quantity": 2,
           "price": 100.00
         },
         {
           "item_name": "Product B",
           "quantity": 1,
           "price": 300.00
         }
       ]
     }
     NOTE: The JSON structure will vary based on the document type and the extracted information.
     ```
4. **Handle Unknown Document Types:**
   - If the document type cannot be determined, extract as much relevant information as possible and format it in a generic JSON structure.
NOTE: never include \n, dont use this format \"document_type\": \"cover_letter\", use general json format .
